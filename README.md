# Udemy_course_Analysis
Data analysis on Udemy courses likely focused on evaluating the performance and characteristics of various courses. I  have explored insights such as the most popular subjects, the relationship between price and the number of subscribers, or the impact of factors like the number of lectures and content duration on user engagement. Additionally, examining trends over time or differences across course levels (e.g., beginner, intermediate) could provide valuable insights into course demand and user preferences. Let me know if you'd like to elaborate on specific findings or visualizations!
